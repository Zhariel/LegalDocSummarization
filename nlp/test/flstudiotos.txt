This section only applies to the User who is a “Multiple Academic User”, being
a current member of the faculty or staff of a recognized educational institution, having purchased a ‘5 User Academic Lab Pack’ or being identified as one (1) of the five (5) Users; or
a full-time or part-time student currently enrolled at such a recognized educational institution, having purchased a ‘5 User Academic Lab Pack’ or being identified as one (1) of the five (5) users.
 
The issuance of this “5 User Academic EULA” is conditioned upon the User’s current status as a Multiple Academic User. If so, the Multiple Academic User can obtain the Software license at a discounted price.
The provisions of the EULA also apply to Multiple Academic Users, but only if the provisions of this 5 User Academic EULA do not state otherwise.
 
User Rights

For as long as the Multiple Academic User is not in breach of the 5 User Academic EULA and in consideration of payment of the license fee, Image Line hereby grants the Multiple Academic User, a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide and revocable license, being the right to use five (5) copies of the Software (and its user manual) as a single person, company or institution who uses the Software in an educational, academic environment. The Software is licensed, not sold.

The Multiple Academic User may personally access these copies of the Software through a network, provided that the Multiple Academic User as well as any other person who accesses these copies through the network remains within the five (5) user limitation, regardless of whether the Software is used at different times or concurrently. Any, even non-simultaneous, use by more than five (5) people of the Software is strictly prohibited unless the Multiple Academic User owns more 5 User Academic Lab Packs. Upon purchase of this Software license, these five (5) persons have to be identified.
 
The Multiple Academic User may use the Software solely for individual and personal purposes, personal education and study including all other non-commercial activities that are consistent with the Multiple Academic User’s academic, teaching and research activities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Multiple Academic User may not use the Software for the purpose of conducting, or in connection with, any commercial purposes or business purposes, whether “profit” or “not-for-profit”. Any work performed or produced as a result of use of this Software cannot be performed or produced for the benefit of other parties for a fee, compensation or any other reimbursement or remuneration.
 
This license and associated Software may not be assigned or transferred to another party, and any such attempted assignment or transfer will be null and void.

Consequently, the Multiple Academic User may not put this Software at the free disposal of other teachers and/or students, nor is the Multiple Academic User authorized to resell this Software.
Termination

If the Multiple Academic User ceases to be an Multiple Academic User the User has to notify Image Line and the Software license will be terminated without prior notice.
 
In reliance of the Multiple Academic User’s representation as a Multiple Academic User, Image Line has charged the Multiple Academic User fees that have been discounted from its standard fee. If the Multiple Academic User’s representation proves to have been untrue, Image Line reserves the right to cancel the license and block the account.
